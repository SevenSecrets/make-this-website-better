# Make this website better

This is a coding challenge for Etch Junior Developer job applicants.

We would like you to fork this repo, make the website better and open a PR that describes what has been done and why it's better.

There's no right answer, we just want to see what you're interested in.

## Progress Notes

### Initial Notes/Things to look at

- Aesthetic changes (grey background on some elements, formatting on form, Team Work Makes The Dream Work)
- Refactoring existing code
- Improving efficiency (may not be relevant on a single page)
- Documentation (doing that right now)
- Accessibility (both for people with disabilities and things which affect readability for abled people etc)
- Security/Privacy (not a huge concern b/c there's no backend/database this is being saved into rn but some stuff could still maybe be exposed)

What are the user's objectives? What are the business' objectives?
